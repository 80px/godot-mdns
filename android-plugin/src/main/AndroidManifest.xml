  Manifest for the MulticastLock Godot Android plugin.

  The namespace is defined via the `namespace` property in build.gradle.
  The CHANGE_WIFI_MULTICAST_STATE permission is NOT declared here — it must
  be added in the Godot Export > Android > Permissions panel so Godot merges
  it into the final APK/AAB manifest. Adding it here would duplicate it and
  can cause Gradle merge warnings.
