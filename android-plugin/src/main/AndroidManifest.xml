  Manifest for the MulticastLock Godot Android plugin.

  Only declares the package. The CHANGE_WIFI_MULTICAST_STATE permission is
  NOT declared here — it must be added in the Godot Export > Android > Permissions
  panel so Godot merges it into the final APK/AAB manifest. Adding it here
  would duplicate it and can cause Gradle merge warnings.
